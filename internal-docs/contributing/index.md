This section covers local setup, docs conventions, release flow, and governance expectations.

This section is primarily for maintainers and contributors to this repository, not first-time package consumers.

## Priorities

- preserve deterministic behavior
- preserve cross-runtime parity
- maintain schema contract compatibility
- add/update shared cases for behavior changes

## Start here
