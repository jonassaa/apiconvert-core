# Intent and Boundaries

Apiconvert.Core is conversion logic only.

## Intent

- rule-driven API transformation
- deterministic and side-effect-free execution
- parity between .NET and TypeScript runtimes

## Out of scope

- API gateway and proxy features
- auth, HTTP, persistence, orchestration, and UI concerns
- external I/O in conversion paths
