# Troubleshooting Decision Tree

1. parse failure -> validate input format and parser assumptions
2. strict normalization failure -> fix schema/rule shape
3. runtime conversion errors -> inspect rule path and source resolution
4. unexpected output -> enable trace and compare execution paths
5. parity mismatch -> run shared case in both runtimes and parity gate
